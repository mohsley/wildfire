HYSPLIT Concentration Data Visualization
======================================

The images in this directory show the normalized concentration data
prepared for ConvLSTM modeling.

Time progression follows the original hours from 16 through 15 (next day).

Sequence of hours:
  Sequence position 0: Hour 16
  Sequence position 1: Hour 17
  Sequence position 2: Hour 18
  Sequence position 3: Hour 19
  Sequence position 4: Hour 20
  Sequence position 5: Hour 21
  Sequence position 6: Hour 22
  Sequence position 7: Hour 23
  Sequence position 8: Hour 0
  Sequence position 9: Hour 1
  Sequence position 10: Hour 2
  Sequence position 11: Hour 3
  Sequence position 12: Hour 4
  Sequence position 13: Hour 5
  Sequence position 14: Hour 6
  Sequence position 15: Hour 7
  Sequence position 16: Hour 8
  Sequence position 17: Hour 9
  Sequence position 18: Hour 10
  Sequence position 19: Hour 11
  Sequence position 20: Hour 12
  Sequence position 21: Hour 13
  Sequence position 22: Hour 14
  Sequence position 23: Hour 15

The data has been log-transformed and normalized to [0,1] range.
